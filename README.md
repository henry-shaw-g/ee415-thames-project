# Notes on package installation & virtual environments:
1. Used packages are listed in requirements.txt. Use pip to install these, preferably within a virtual env. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Notes on how we will export for use on the lab computers:
1. Idk sounds hard.

# Notes on execution:
1. It will be easiest if we debug run all files from the root directory. If using vscode, this can be done by manipulating launch.json.
