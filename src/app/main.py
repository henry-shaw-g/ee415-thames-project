# for program loop:
1. Have user select or use new spreadsheet to work out of. 
(this is actually easier with CLI since they should already be in the working directory.)
2. Await user input action:
    a. Manually enter a bee sample.
    b. Process a bee sample from image file.
    c. Process a bee sample from webcam.
    d. Exit, save and close. (or variations of this)
3. Execute selection action, return to step 2.
